# Shakespeare's Works

This is just a little fun I had with the data files from the https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/ project.

Most of the functionality already exists on the Open Source Shakespeare server. The most useful addition is probably the view where you can look at individual characters in a play, which will show you a couple of lines before and after the mention or comment of the actual part.

You may find a working instance here:

If you want to build it yourself:

```
gradle installDist
build/install/works/bin/works
```
